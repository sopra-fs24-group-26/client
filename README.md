# Saboteur Web Version

A webversion of the board game Saboteur, project for the Software Engineering Lab FS24 at UZH. <br>
Our focus was to implement something that would exite us, leading to the creation of a simple web version of a fun board game we had played together

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

## Technologies used

### Server

-   [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - Framework for building Java-based web applications
-   [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Build automation
-   [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) - Testing framework for Java
-   [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) - Code quality and security analysis tool
-   [JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/) - Java Code Coverage Library

### Client

-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Package manager
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-   [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) - The Game Framework used
-   [DiceBear](https://www.dicebear.com/) - Avatar library

## High-level components

In the client repository, the three key components are Manager, Scenes and Entity. The entry point and main game flow are handled in the core folder. For usability and extendability, we also defined types, constants, and helper functions that are stored in several subfolders and play an important role in our project.

### Manager

The Manager layer is responsible for fetching session-related information from the server. On a constant time interval, the GeneralManager sends ping request and receives a data package with all the shared information. The data is then propagated to sub-managers, each stores and updates the information of one kind of entity.

The AdjacencyManager handles the game logic. It builds the game world and checks valid tile placements.

## Acknowledgments

We thank the team of the Sopra FS24 modul for giving us the opportunity to freely work on a project

## Pattern

**Issue:** "Userstory: Issue Summary" <br>
**Branch:** "Issuenumber-issue-description" [^1] <br>
**Commit:** "Issuenumber: Commit message" <br>
**PR:** "Userstory: PR/Issue description" <br>

[^1]: This should get auto generated by GitHub when forming a branch for an issue

## Workflow

1. Create Userstories
2. Create architecture through in person meeting.
3. Create issues based on userstories, connecting them in development tasks.
4. Assign issues to members.
5. Members create branches and commit changes.
6. Members open pull requests which the others review.
7. When merged, issue gets closed.

## Formatting

-   Generally good structuring in folders (for example for all DTOs)
-   Generally small functions and classes
-   For TS: Prettier formatting
-   For Java: still to find out
-   Only UI stuff in Phaser files
